# hal3d

hal3d (pronounced haled) is a three-dimensional Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian code that solves Euler's inviscid compressible equations of hydrodynamics, including subcell swept edge remapping to support hourglass elimination

There is currently an effort to port the code to modern architectures and implement multi-material interfaces.
